As a dedicated final year PhD graduate at the Institute of Experimental Hematology and Transfusion Medicine (IHT), University Hospital Bonn, I am excited to explore new opportunities where I can apply my 6+ years of research experience in Hematology, Oncology, and Structural/Protein Biology. With a passion and strong commitment to advance for scientific reseach and innovation, I am prepared to contribute to significant initiatives and lead projects that aim to create a lasting impact.

Having been raised with a scientific background, my deep-rooted curiosity to understand the molecular mechanisms of life elevated was during my Master’s (Molecular Biology) from University of Mysore, India. I commenced my initial laboratory on-site research experience (2018) at the Indian Institute of Science which set the foundation for my scientific (Oncology). Subsequently, I served as a Research Assistant at the Institute of Bioinformatics and Applied Biotechnology (IBAB) in Bengaluru, India, where I led projects that elucidated the intricate 3D-structures of DNA repair proteins in Oncology, utilizing XRC and XRD facilities at IISc. 

During my PhD, I immersed myself to deepen my expertise in Hematology, Protein Biology and Structural Bioinofrmatics. I mastered advanced techniques, including cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and many more. These methodologies enabled me to investigate the complex molecular interactions and structural dynamics of proteins, particularly regarding the molecular basis of Hemophilia A. Driven by reinforcing my guiding principle: “If you want to understand function, study structure” (F. Crick), I not only honed my technical skills but also developed a strong aptitude for data analysis and interpretation, which allowed me to draw meaningful conclusions from my experiments.
